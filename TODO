// TODO : Overwrite default php snippets
// First install Package Resource Viewer.
// Extract "PHP" package (ctrl+shift+p -> extract -> select PHP). If PHP is not there, most probably you already have it extracted in your Packages folder, so delete it.
// Enter the extracted PHP directory and run "rm *.sublime-snippet"
// or remove all snippets, BUT NOT the other files.
Rename this directory to something like PHPCustom (this step leaves syntax and other PHP stuff, but not the snippets).
// Add PHP to ignored packages in the settings
